## âœ… Features of interest / 2022-06-26

* Exploring uncompressed data via complex RGBA settings
** Accelerated parsing where possible
** Requires format-specific settings (e.g. no point showing/storing RGBA settings for DXT)
** Do not need to cover the entire range of possibilities immediately though
** Having shortcuts in the form of common presets would be time-saving
* Separating index formats from color formats
** allow using color formats for parsing the palette to be used with the index map

Current state:

* Hardcoded RGBA format parsers
* One format defines the index and the palette, resulting in combinations

Decisions:

* Index map parsers can be hardcoded (currently only needed 4/8-bit for PSX)
* RGBA parser feature set:
** bytes per pixel (1-4), little/big endianness
** gray or RGB color space, all channels are optional (default alpha = 255, others = 0)
** per-channel settings: number of bits (1-8), bit offset (0-31)
*** channel could be disabled by setting #bits to 0
** vectorized parsing (every parse is some medium-sized multiple of 64 bytes [cache line])
* how to handle exotic formats like PSX RGB5A1?
** 0x8000 is black, 0 is transparent, with any other color the alpha bit is basically ignored (some games fill it, others don't)
** use a custom parser for these, it's expected that the generic parser will be enough only to investigate, not to cover 100% of cases
** EDIT: also handling with a "black-only alpha" option
* when/how to save the properties of the format?
** all settings should persist in memory while workspace is loaded to allow for fast switching
** only the settings relevant to the current format should be written to the workspace file
